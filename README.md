# Tunic

> The simple web whistle to piano key translator.

Tunes pop into my head a lot. When they do, I record them in voice memos and then later try to figure out the piano keys that match the tune I hummed or whistled. I'm not adept yet at knowing the note from hearing it myself but code can translate it for me.
